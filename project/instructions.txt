1. Clone the repo
2. Install tensorflow, opencv and numpy

setup a virtual environment using

python -m venv venv.

Then initialize using the code
source venv/bin/activate

Windows: pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy

Once all files are downloaded place 5 to 6 pictures of a person's face you want to recognize on the face_data folders

Save all changes and run the following scripts in sequnece:

python setup_model.py
python register_faces.py

This sets up the embeddings required and names it known_faces.pkl

To run the recognition model, 

run this sequence of code
sudo chown root:gpio /dev/gpiomem
sudo chmod g+rw /dev/gpiomem

after running those two codes, log out of the Raspberry PI and log back in

afterwards run this code below to run the recognition model
python quick_doorbell.py

after this code is run, press the button connected to the Raspberry PI to take the image and you will receive the recognition output.
